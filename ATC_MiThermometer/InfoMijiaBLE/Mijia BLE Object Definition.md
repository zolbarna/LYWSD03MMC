# Mijia BLE Object Definition

This document defines the Object ID and Object format in MiBeacon usage scenarios. The device needs to broadcast the MiBeacon containing the Object when reporting events or properties. The gateway will parse the valid Object and report it to the Mijia backend, which can be displayed by the APP or perform a series of automated operations.

**BLE Object format**

|      Field      | length |     description     |
| :-------------: | :----: | :-----------------: |
|    Object ID    |   2    | Mijia definition ID |
| Object Data Len |   1    |     Data length     |
|   Object Data   |   N    |        data         |

## BLE gateway restrictions

The BLE device reports events or attributes (MiBeacon including Object) to the Xiaomi IoT platform through the gateway. In order to ensure that the gateway can report data normally and enable users to get a good user experience, the BLE gateway needs to follow the following restrictions:

- Support up to 50 devices to report information under the same gateway;
- Older gateways such as MTK7697 1.x, etc. only support access to devices of up to 15 categories;
- When there are more than 200 BLE devices broadcasting data around the gateway, the performance of the gateway will be affected;
- MiBeacon data with a length greater than 31 bytes (Byte) is not supported;
- Each BLE device can only support up to 7 objects;
- Each MiBeacon broadcast package can only contain one Object;
- The effective data length of each Object is up to 10 bytes (Byte).

## ID definition

Defined by Mijia, the distribution is as follows:

- 0x0000-0x1001 are Bluetooth general events
- 0x1002-0x1FFF are Bluetooth general attributes
- 0x2000-0x2FFF are vendor-defined attributes, and the corresponding vendor shall apply to Xiaomi
- 0x3000-0x3FFF is a manufacturer-defined event, and the corresponding manufacturer applies to Xiaomi

In order to ensure that the data is timely and effective, and not to cause heavy load pressure on the Mijia server, the Mijia BLE gateway will filter different types of data according to the ID. When the data is separated from the previously reported data by a certain time and exceeds a certain amount of change, The BLE gateway will forward the data to the Mijia server. Therefore, the time interval and variation are specifically defined, as shown in the following table.

In order to ensure that the events and attributes represented by the Object can be received by the Mijia BLE gateway, the MiBeacon containing the Object needs to be retransmitted many times. Refer to the Mijia BLE MiBeacon protocol for details.
